# Configuration Directory

Place additional configuration files here as needed.

For now, all configuration is done through environment variables (see `env.example` in the project root).

Future configuration files might include:
- Bot-specific settings
- Check rules and thresholds
- ERP connection profiles
- Schedule definitions
